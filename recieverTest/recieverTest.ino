 * How much does steering affect the tank tracks, particularly at speed.

 *
 * This value is the difference between the 2 tracks (measured from -127 to 127) when the stick is in an extreme corner.
 *
 * NB. floor(log2(steeringCoefficient)) is the amount you have to move the stick up or down to have an affect on the tracks when the stick is to the extreme left or right
 * (i.e. the central vertical deadzone at the extreme of steering). 
 * This aspect can largely be ignored as even when this value is 127, the deadzone is only 8 positions either side of the middle (which isn't very many out of 127)
